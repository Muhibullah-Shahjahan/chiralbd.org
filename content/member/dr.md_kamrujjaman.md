[Dr. Md. Kamrujjaman](https://www.du.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_details/MAT/163#) is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics, University of Dhaka. He is a regular faculty of this University since 2007. He received his Ph.D. from University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada in 2016. He completed his B.S. Honours and Master of Science from University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Dr. Kamrujjaman is serving as i) Associate Editor, GANIT: Journal of Bangladesh Mathematical Society, ii) Joint-Secretary: Society for Bangladesh Mathematical Biology, iii) National Advisor: Global Public Health Research Foundation, and iv) Members of many world recognized organization such as SIAM, American Mathematical Society and so on. He published numerous research articles in peer-reviewed journals, and undergraduate mathematics books. Many undergraduate and graduate students successfully completed their research project with his direct supervision. The research interests of Dr. Kamrujjaman are in the Modeling in Mathematical Ecology & Epidemiology, Dynamical System, Numerical Analysis & Computing, Analysis of Partial Differential Equations, and Biomedical Applications of Mathematics. Specifically, Dr. Kamrujjaman focus to establish theoretical results of rigorous mathematical models and verify the results by simulating the problems. The focal point of the research in Epidemiological Dynamics is to use adaptive techniques to develop an integrated modelling and computing framework. Fortran, Matlab, Mathematica and STATA are the computing surface to write the programming codes, data analysis and to develop the algorithm.
