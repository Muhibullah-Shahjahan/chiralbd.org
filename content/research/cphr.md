Health Data Research Organization deals with genomics and public research; the Center for Public Health Research(CPHR) is dedicated to public health. The CPHR team focuses on the public health problems in Bangladesh. The design study for generating data for HDRO and preprocess the secondary data to give an insightful shape. 



### The Challenges
According to [worldometers.info](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/bangladesh-population/), Bangladesh, with a population of 166,275,884 million in 2021, is a country in South Asia. Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely populated countries, with a population density of 1265 people per $km^2$. In South-East Asia the main public health issues are infectious diseases and communicable diseases. Public health has improved markedly in Bangladesh over the past several decades. Nevertheless, Bangladesh faces major health challenges.Bangladesh is faced a number of health problems, which can be classified as follows:

- Population problems
- Communicable diseases problems
- Nutritional problems
- Environmental sanitation problems
- Health problems

### Aims 
- To conduct health surveys for understanding the current public health problems. 
- To use health data in multiple forms to understand the cause of diseases and improve people's lives.
- We are working to help policymakers to make data-driven decisions by using raw data. 

### Mission
{{< figure src="/img/starter-guide/public_health.jpg" width="450px" class="right-inline" >}}

We will empower data science to transform public health research by linking it to sources of data beyond the healthcare services, along with other government sectors, organizations, and data on health-related environments. While those who work in these fields may not view their data as having a direct impact on public health, decisions made in education, housing, technology, engineering, law, fiscal policy, environmental science, planning, history, and behavioral sciences all have an effect on our health.


### Methodology

I will generally ask you to work on problems that I have not solved myself and you will not be able to find a packaged solution on the internet. Also, I may not be able to provide solutions to your questions. Actually, there may not even be a solution. Accept it, you're doing research now. Find a simpler question that will put you on the path to an answer. Doing **research is a continuous process of adaptation** in _both_ posing the questions _and_ proposing solutions. In other words, *if you can't find the answer, change the question*! Start with the simplest questions and simplest solution proposals and work your way towards the more relevant issues. For further information, please have a look at Hamming's lecture on 'You and Your Research', [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw "Hamming video, 1995") (1995) or [html](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html "Hamming html, 1986") (1986), and think about how this relates to your work.
