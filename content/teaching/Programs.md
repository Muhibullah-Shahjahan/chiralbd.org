HDRO runs different programs regarding health data analytics, bioinformatics, genomic data science. The aim of these programs to develop a community on scientific computing in the field of health science. The courses are free, and some are paid. The course fees of these courses will spend on our research. 

## Scientific Computing for Biologists
Scientific computing is the collection of tools, techniques, and theories required to solve the mathematical models of problems in science and engineering on a computer. However, now scientific computing plays a vital role in health sciences; we enable scientific computing to solve genomic problems and improve public health. We have several courses on scientific computing, including Introduction to Scientific Computing with Python, Introduction to Scientific Computing with R, and Introduction to Scientific Computing with Julia.
